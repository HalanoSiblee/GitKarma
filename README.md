it's massive idea for good project work around donating system<br>
by simply break the currency into fragments and distributing it across nodes<br>

is very small and need small team to maintaining it<br>
all we need is :<br>

- Hosting server
- SQL database
- Cryptographic
- Banking system
- A social platform
